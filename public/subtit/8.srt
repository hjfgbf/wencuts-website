00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,120
Chapter 8

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,839
Special Effects and the Render Settings

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,825
When you create a video and render it, there are some

4
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:09,839
specific settings

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,517
In the settings, go to settings color management in the Da

6
00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:14,970
Vanci

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,162
In the color management, go to Timeline Color Space and

8
00:00:18,162 --> 00:00:19,190
Output Color Space

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,000
Both of these are in REC 709, so check them

10
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:25,100
And in the Da Vanci Resolve, go to Preferences

11
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,440
Choose Generals

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,170
Turn on Use Mac Display Color for Viewers

13
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:34,000
Use Mac Display Color will only show to Mac users

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,979
It won't show to Windows users

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,000
Special Effects

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,371
After creating a video, we can use these effects to add

17
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:42,640
glow, light rays and special effects

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,000
First, create a basic grade in the video

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,930
I'm in the 9th node now

20
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,700
There will be effects in the right side corner

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,290
Click on it, go to search and search for glow

22
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,310
Drag this glow and place it in the 9th node

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,990
After placing it, if you control it, the glow will rise in

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,790
the full video

25
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,064
To control it, go to the qualifier and qualify it where you

26
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:19,450
want

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,939
I'll turn on the highlight

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,969
I turned on the highlight and qualified it where I wanted

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,489
Now I'll drag the glow back and place it

30
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:37,209
Now when I raise the glow, the glow will rise in that place

31
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,309
I can also control the feather rate

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,140
Next, type light rays in the effects

33
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,969
Drag the light rays and place it in the 9th node

34
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:50,129
Wherever there is a highlight, the rays will form from there

35
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:52,930
It will be good when you try this in an outdoor footage

36
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,719
I'll add light rays in this footage

37
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,430
I'll drag the light rays and place it in the 11th node

38
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,700
It will form like this

39
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,319
I don't need it in all the places

40
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,840
I only need it in this place

41
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,939
I'll use masking and qualify it

42
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:19,539
We can even turn off the power window

43
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,439
I'll adjust it in this node

44
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,129
If you adjust the X and Y value, we can change the position

45
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:26,949
of the light rays

46
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:35,180
I'll increase the length of the light rays

47
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:37,869
I'll adjust the Y value

48
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,859
We can control the threshold of the light rays

49
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:50,930
We can even soften and sharpen the rays of the light rays

50
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,879
Now I'll turn off the light rays in this video

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,719
It will look like this when the light rays are turned on

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,637
If you use special effects like this in the video you are

53
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:08,319
grading, your video will be even better

54
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,399
Another important thing

55
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:12,145
You can even use the grab still for all the color scenes

56
00:03:12,145 --> 00:03:12,910
you are grading

57
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,329
You can even use it for the next footage

58
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,800
If you right click on the footage you are grading, there is

59
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,299
an option called grab still

60
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:22,625
If you click on it, your let's save will appear in the

61
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:22,969
gallery

62
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,840
Then special effects

63
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,120
Let's see how to add a basic LED in special effects

64
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:27,489
Add a serial node

65
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,760
Drag the color space transform and add it to this

66
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,909
In the input color space, select the camera you took in this

67
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:39,599
I'll select Sony S-Gamut 3

68
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:41,650
Input gamma

69
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,050
We have to choose which log to shoot

70
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,479
This is Sony S-Log 3, I chose 3

71
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,930
In the output color space, we have to choose RED709

72
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,810
In the output gamma, we have to choose RED709A

73
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,649
You can bring a rush color video without controlling lift,

74
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:07,159
gamma, gain and offset

75
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,870
I'll show you the difference

76
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,060
Before and after

77
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,409
The reason why this basic LED is useful

78
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:17,350
If you apply this LED in the video before grading

79
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,180
It will be useful for you to get the saturation level equal

80
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,899
when you grade

81
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,620
Chapter 8 is completed with this

82
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,859
So far, we have covered the maximum tools in color page

83
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:29,180
After this, we have to learn how to grade using these tools

84
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:32,363
For that, I would have recorded the color grading in the

85
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:34,259
screen and put it in the voiceover

86
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,160
