1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,507
Hi, this is the homepage of DaVinci Resolve.

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,735
You can see the projects you have already done here.

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,875
I am going to open a new project now.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,750
When we open DaVinci Resolve,

5
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:19,368
Media page, Cut page, Edit page, Grading page, Fairlight

6
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:23,110
page, and finally they would have given you the Delivery page.

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,000
First, let's go to the Edit page.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,791
Go to the Edit page and click Media.

9
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:32,336
If you right click here, you will see Import Media.

10
00:00:32,696 --> 00:00:36,696
If you click on it, you can import any media you want.

11
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,127
Now, I am going to...

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,279
Umm...

13
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:46,735
I have kept the coarse footage here.

14
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,829
I am going to import all the footage I need.

15
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:59,004
Here, it will ask change the frame rate.

16
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:03,412
It is up to you whether you want to change the frame rate or not.

17
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:06,361
I am going to drag this footage in the timeline.

18
00:01:08,727 --> 00:01:11,247
I don't need audio. I will cut the audio.

19
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,819
Now, the next step is to go to the grading page.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,980
Once you go to the page, the layout will look like this.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,367
Before grading a footage, we need to know

22
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:25,753
why it is being shot in Log.

23
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,834
Why is the camera being shot in Log instead of Standard?

24
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,260
When we shoot in Standard, we don't get to see the

25
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:33,151
highlights and shadows in detail.

26
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:36,698
When we shoot in Log, we get to see the highlights and

27
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:38,114
shadows in detail.

28
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,439
Now, I am going to show you an example.

29
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,830
Here, we have the footage shot in Standard and in Log.

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's see the variations in this.

31
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:48,687
This is the footage shot in Standard.

32
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:51,390
In this, the highlights will be more in this area.

33
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,709
The shadows will be darker in this area.

34
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:54,709
Why is it like this?

35
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:57,309
The highlights are more in the background than in the subject.

36
00:01:57,309 --> 00:02:00,000
The shadows are more in the background than in the subject.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,612
That is why, when we shoot in Standard, the highlights will

38
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:04,159
be over highlighted.

39
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,459
The shadows will be over shadowed.

40
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,672
Similarly, when we shoot in Log, this is the footage shot in Log.

41
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,584
This is the log footage.

42
00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:13,375
The details got collected in the highlights.

43
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:17,125
It is difficult to get the details from the footage shot in Standard.

44
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,623
Even if we reduce the highlights and grade it,

45
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:20,979
it will look like a mashup.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,677
We can't get the details from it.

47
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:25,270
If we grade it from the footage shot in Log,

48
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,542
we can get the details from it.

49
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:30,000
In this, the highlights are not over highlighted.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The shadows are not over highlighted.

51
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,892
Now we know why we shoot in Standard and Log.

52
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:37,564
When we shoot in Standard, we don't get the details from it.

53
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:39,715
When we shoot in Log, we get the details from it.

54
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:41,032
This is the job of the camera.

55
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:43,431
Now, let's see how to grade the footage.

56
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:44,834
Let me explain the tools first.

57
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,159
These are the primary color wheels.

58
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,159
These are the basic tools for color grading.

59
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,444
These are Lift, Gamma, Gain and Offset.

60
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:52,584
These four have different variations.

61
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:55,209
I will use the grayscale to show you the variations.

62
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:04,528
Lift is for contrast.

63
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:05,883
Gamma is also for contrast.

64
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:08,213
Let me show you the difference of these both.

65
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,600
Now, when we increase the contrast in Lift,

66
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:16,136
look at the feather rate of the grayscale.

67
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:18,141
Look at how sharp it is.

68
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:21,204
I will increase the contrast in Gamma.

69
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,451
Look at the feather rate of this.

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,329
The job of Lift is to increase the contrast in the videos

71
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,000
in the darker places.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,190
The job of Gamma is to increase the contrast level in the

73
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,797
videos by increasing the feather rate of Gamma.

74
00:03:38,797 --> 00:03:41,127
If the contrast is too high, the video will look black.

75
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:43,583
So we can use both Gamma and Lift in a video.

76
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,387
Now, Gain.

77
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:49,922
The job of Gain is to increase the highlight where there is highlights in the videos.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,651
Now, if I increase the gain,

79
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:55,448
As you can see, the highlighted area get over highlighted.

80
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:56,860
This is the work of gain.

81
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,420
Next, we can see Off-set.

82
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,000
The use of Off-set is

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,855
Not of highlight or contrast.

84
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:03,717
To manage the colour tone, we use off-set

85
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:06,000
I will show you when I create the video.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,380
Now, you have seen how Primary wheels work.

87
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,025
Next, we are going to see how Log wheels work.

88
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:13,442
You have a option in Primary color wheels.

89
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:15,355
If you click, the log wheels will change.

90
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:19,899
When we reduce the shadows, the place with shadows will

91
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,042
change to a prime contrast.

92
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:23,623
When we increase the contrast in the lifts, 

93
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:24,728
the look will be spread out.

94
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:27,145
When we increase the contrast in the shadows, the place

95
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:29,658
with contrast will remain the same.

96
00:04:30,797 --> 00:04:34,797
The work of midtone is same like Gamma.

97
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:37,658
When we reduce the midtone, you can see a difference.

98
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:39,791
This will stop the contrast.

99
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,089
This will give a stop.

100
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:44,750
It will cut the variation between highlight and contrast.

101
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:46,254
Next, we will see the highlights.

102
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:50,000
There we have seen the highlight when we increase the gain.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,750
We have done the same thing here, but we have made it sharper.

104
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,000
The offset is the same here.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,500
We always use the offset when we fix the color tone.

106
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Next, we are going to see HDR wheels.

107
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,298
You know what HDR wheels are.

108
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:04,334
High Dynamic Range.

109
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:07,423
HDR wheels are the wheels next to Primary wheels.

110
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:08,550
Here it is.

111
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:10,729
Now, I am adjusting the High Dynamic Range.

112
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:12,729
This will elevate in the gray scale.

113
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,542
High Dynamic Range will have dark, shadow, light and global.

114
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,000
Primary wheels are mandatory.

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The functions of  are like Dark, Shadows, Light and Global

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,797
Lift, Gamma, Gain and Offset.

117
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:26,892
Now, I am adjusting the Dark.

118
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:28,836
When it elevates in the gray scale,

119
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:30,834
you can understand what is happening there.

120
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:33,176
When High Dynamic Range works, it does not disturb the

121
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:35,709
points where contrast and highlights intersect.

122
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:39,918
When I adjust here, the contrast is adjusted where there is more contrast.

123
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:44,505
When I do the same in the shadows, the contrast is adjusted.

124
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:47,375
It does not disturb the intersecting points.

125
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,191
When we do Primary and Log wheels,

126
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:52,000
it disturbs the intersecting points.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But when we do it in HDR, it does not.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Next, we are going to see the Graph.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,450
The first option is

130
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,834
Curves Custom.

131
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,808
This is for...We can adjust the RGB with this.

132
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:05,959
Not only that, it is a major option to adjust the

133
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,734
highlights and contrast.

134
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:11,981
The benefit of the Graph is we can bring the contrast range equal to highlight.

135
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:13,981
You can see when I adjust the Graph.

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,355
I am adjusting the Graph.

137
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:18,779
You can see when I adjust the Graph.

138
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,892
The contrast side is highlighted.

139
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:24,000
But the intersecting point has more feather rate.

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is a big plus point in the Graph.

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,698
When we use the Graph to adjust the contrast, it is even

142
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:30,209
better to watch the video.

143
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:33,307
Not only can we adjust the contrast, we can also adjust the

144
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:33,980
highlights.

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,070
Now, we have a good clarity for contrast and highlights.

146
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,569
Why I said this is,

147
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:40,701
When we change the color from Log,

148
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,987
our first step is to  adjust the contrast and highlights.

149
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:46,000
Now, I am going to show you the other tools randomly.

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,317
In the next videos, we will see how to use the tools.

151
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:50,899
We have seen the Primary Log Wheels,

152
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:53,886
HDR, and this is RGB Mixer.

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,550
RGB Mixer is Red, Green, Blue.

154
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,645
RGB Mixer is a tool to control these three.

155
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:02,000
Then, Motion Effects.

156
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Motion Effects are the grains in some of our videos.

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,702
Motion Effects is used to reduce the grains and to control it.

158
00:07:10,702 --> 00:07:12,000
Then, Graph Page.

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,273
In the Graph Page, we have seen only one graph.

160
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:16,432
In the Graph Page, we have 7 tools.

161
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:18,622
7 tools are Hue vs Hue.

162
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,048
Hue vs Hue is to control the color in a video.

163
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:24,363
Red, Green, Blue, Orange, Pink 

164
00:07:24,363 --> 00:07:27,718
We use Hue to bring many variations of colors in the video.

165
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,084
Hue vs Saturation.

166
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:33,375
In a video, we use this hue to increase pointed saturation.

167
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,750
hue vs luminance

168
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,004
luminance is considered as highlight.

169
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:40,389
In a colour changing place, if we want to raise the highlight 

170
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:41,591
or to lower the highlight

171
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:42,994
This graph is used.

172
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,584
Fifth, luminance vs Saturation.

173
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:48,209
luminance is to increasing or lowering the highlight in the saturation.

174
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:50,209
Sixth, Saturation vs Saturation.

175
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:54,701
Saturation is concentrated in R value that is Red Value.

176
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:59,168
After increasing Saturation, our video becomes more red

177
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:01,168
and it shows the over raised red in the video.

178
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:03,391
we use the graph to control that.

179
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:05,658
Finally, Saturation vs luminance.

180
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:07,279
Next tool, Color Slice.

181
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,489
Color Slice is used to separate the colors in a video.

182
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:14,216
For example, Yellow, Red, Blue and Green in a video.

183
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:17,924
Color Slice is used to separate these folur colors in a video.

184
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,785
Qualifier.

185
00:08:18,785 --> 00:08:23,584
We use Qualifier to change the color of a subject.

186
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:27,556
For example, we can change the color of our skin tone or

187
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:29,735
the subject in the background.

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,710
Power Window.

189
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,375
We use Power Window to mask and change the color of a video.

190
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:38,000
It has 5 tools. Circle, Rectangle, Pen Tool.

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,334
We use Circle, Rectangle, Pen Tool to mask.

192
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:40,375
Tracking.

193
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:48,254
We use Tracking to track the face using the power window.

194
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:50,000
Next tool, Magic Masking.

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,715
Magic Masking is used to rotate and separate the subject.

196
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:57,000
Next tool, Blur.

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,550
Blur is used to control the sharpness and blur of a video.

198
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,505
If we decrease the blur, it becomes sharp and if we

199
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:05,750
increase it, it becomes blur.

200
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,861
Now we know the maximum tools in the color page.

201
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:10,653
I will tell you what Scopes are.

202
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:12,653
We call this Scopes.

203
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:17,478
Scopes are used to decide the value range of

204
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:20,380
Red, Green and Blue values in a video.

205
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,417
There are 5 types of Scopes.

206
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,000
Parade, Waveform, Vector Scope,

207
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,625
Histogram and CIE Chromaticity.

208
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,203
With these Scopes, we can calculate

209
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:32,626
RGB, Skin Tones and Highlights.

210
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:35,507
We have keyframes next to the Scopes.

211
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:39,342
In video editing, as we add keyframes to zoom in and zoom out.

212
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:42,227
Likewise we can add keyframes in colours to do ups and downs.

213
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:43,866
Color page introduction is over.

214
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:46,459
Let's see how to create a video from the next chapter.
