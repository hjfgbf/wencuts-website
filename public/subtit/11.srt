00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,427
In this chapter, I am going to tell you about the small

2
00:00:05,427 --> 00:00:06,780
iconic points in Davinci Resolve.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's take a look at that.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,789
I have already copied and pasted two footages.

5
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,800
I have a footage here and a footage here.

6
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:20,410
I am going to the color page.

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,410
I am going to disable the color of this video.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,859
I am going to disable it and add only one node.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,170
This footage is in the log and this footage is in the grid.

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,479
There is an option to short match this footage in the log.

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,280
Select this footage.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,552
If you right click on this footage using the cursor, there

13
00:00:41,552 --> 00:00:43,640
is an option called short match to this clip.

14
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:45,719
You just need to click it once.

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,170
The color in this footage will be applied to this footage.

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,272
If you are watching a movie and you like the color of that

17
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:56,789
movie, you can short match that color in a footage.

18
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,140
I will show you how to do that.

19
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:00,390
I have a footage in the movie.

20
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:04,168
If you want to apply the color in this footage, select this

21
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:04,719
footage.

22
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,650
If you right click on this footage and click on short match

23
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,130
to this clip, the color in this footage will be applied to

24
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:12,969
this footage.

25
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,640
How does this short match work?

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,963
If you shoot both the clips at the same exposure at the

27
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:21,319
same place, the short match will work.

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,588
If I shoot both the clips at the same exposure at the same

29
00:01:24,588 --> 00:01:27,069
place, the colour will be completed applied.

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,310
Second, let's look at face refinement.

31
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,230
I have opened this footage.

32
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,140
I have already graded it.

33
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,780
I will add a new node.

34
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:40,480
Click on effects.

35
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,000
Type face refinement in the search box.

36
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,730
You will see an effect.

37
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,730
Drag it to that node.

38
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,090
Then a column will open with the effect.

39
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,913
If you type direct faces in frame, a box will be visible in

40
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:04,650
their face.

41
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,224
If you type forward tracking, the box will be visible in

42
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:08,930
their face.

43
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,769
After tracking, we can turn off the effects.

44
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,580
I will zoom in that footage.

45
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,516
In this footage, you can adjust the temperature, tint,

46
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:29,879
softness, brightness of your face.

47
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,794
In the face you have tracked, you can adjust the side

48
00:02:33,794 --> 00:02:37,826
lighting, eye shadows, eyes, lips, teeth, blush, forehead,

49
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:38,800
cheeks, chin.

50
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,200
I will adjust it randomly.

51
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,129
There is an option called shine removal.

52
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,257
When I raise that option, the highlights in their face will

53
00:02:46,257 --> 00:02:47,000
be dissolved.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We can increase that highlight.

55
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:52,409
I will reset it.

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,000
We can adjust the tint.

57
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,310
We can adjust the color boost.

58
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,099
We can adjust the midtone.

59
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,930
We can adjust the contrast.

60
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,689
We can even smoothen the skin.

61
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:17,169
You can see the difference when I adjust it,

62
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,689
note it in the face.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,469
This area and this area will be smooth.

64
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,790
Can you see?

65
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,580
I will reset it.

66
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,759
If you open the teeth, you can adjust the brightness.

67
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:36,099
You can see the difference

68
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:40,650
you can adjust the teeth color.

69
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,318
Like this, you can adjust all the parts of the face

70
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:48,009
separately.

71
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:50,509
Third one, how to apply LUTs in the video?

72
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,520
It is simple.

73
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,180
In the left side corner, there is an option called LUTs.

74
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,120
Open the installed LUTs.

75
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,180
You just need to double tap the LUTs.

76
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,280
LUTs will be applied in this node.

77
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,580
Fourth one,

78
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,210
Lightbox.

79
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,176
If you work on a big project, there will be many clips in

80
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:10,389
it.

81
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,109
All the clips will be visible in the Lightbox.

82
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,924
When we add a node, we can even change the size of the

83
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,410
nodes.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There is an option called clip in the right side corner.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,202
If you drag it, you can increase and decrease the size of

86
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:27,819
the nodes.

87
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,925
If you choose the hand mode while previewing the nodes, it

88
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:33,629
will be easy for you to drag.
