00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,665
Hi, in this chapter, I am going to show you how to do day

2
00:00:06,665 --> 00:00:07,230
for night.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,630
Day for night means, we have shot a footage in the day.

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,949
We have to shift it to night in post.

5
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,199
We will see how to do that.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,750
I have already imported a footage here.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,190
We will see how to do day for night in this footage.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,730
I will cut only the necessary portion in this footage.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,399
I will cut the last part too.

10
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:33,799
I will remove the first frame.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now, we will go to the color page.

12
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,962
Before doing day for night, we can bring this footage to a

13
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:42,750
basic color.

14
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,649
I will cut it like that.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,350
A serial note.

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,509
I will reduce the Lift.

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,539
This way, we can reduce the contrast in everything.

18
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,763
Because we are doing day for night, if there is too much

19
00:00:57,763 --> 00:00:59,590
contrast, it won't be good for day for night.

20
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,320
I will add a second node.

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,859
I will reduce the gamma.

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,469
I will add a third node.

23
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,530
We can slightly raise the gain this time.

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,879
I will add a fourth node.

25
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:24,640
I will increase the saturation.

26
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,183
I will increase the saturation in both the nodes and reduce

27
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:29,210
it in the third node.

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,650
I have reduced it in the third node.

29
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,359
I will add the next node.

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,200
In this node, we can start day for night.

31
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,810
First, I will go to the graph.

32
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:53,859
To do day for night, the tool we use the most is the graph.

33
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,430
I will go to curve custom.

34
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,739
I will link all the colors in this first.

35
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,411
If you drag and drop this place in the graph, the video

36
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:04,590
will look dull.

37
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,069
I will add the next node again.

38
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,199
In this node, I will reduce the saturation to this green.

39
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,840
In night, the color of the leaves won't be clear.

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,420
So, I will reduce the saturation.

41
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:21,780
I will go to the graph.

42
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:24,319
I will select the hue and saturation.

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,689
I will pin the green.

44
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,569
I will pin it and reduce the saturation.

45
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,000
I will add another node.

46
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,490
In this node, I will reduce the temperature.

47
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,482
In night, if the blue tone is high, it will give a night

48
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:42,909
feel.

49
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,639
I have reduced the temperature.

50
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:53,549
I will add another node.

51
00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:01,508
In this node, I will qualify the highlights and make it

52
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:02,310
white.

53
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,729
Because there is no chance of getting blue in highlights.

54
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,439
So, I will reduce the blue in highlights.

55
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,489
I will increase the blur radius.

56
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:21,969
I will reduce the saturation.

57
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:27,169
I will add a serial node again.

58
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,520
In this node, we can use gamma light.

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,960
I will add the next node.

60
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,120
In this node, I will add maskings.

61
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,969
First, I will add a mask to this node.

62
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,909
I will increase the feather rate.

63
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,680
I will invert this mask.

64
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,447
After inverting, I will reduce the gain to the surrounding

65
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:04,850
areas.

66
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,370
I have reduced the gain.

67
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,560
I will show you the difference.

68
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,660
I will add another node.

69
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,040
I will copy this node and paste it in this node.

70
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:36,379
After pasting, I will off invert in masking.

71
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,089
After that, I will reset the primary wheels.

72
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,810
Here, I will increase the gain slightly in the face.

73
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,589
I will add the next node.

74
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,670
In the 15th node, I will increase the blue in gamma.

75
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:07,409
I will add another node.

76
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,220
In this node, I will reduce the highlight fully.

77
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:19,910
I will add another node.

78
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,094
In the 17th node, I will go to the RGB mixer and reduce the

79
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:27,879
blue tone.

80
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:42,519
I will add the next node.

81
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,930
In the 18th node, I will go to the masking and select the

82
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,819
gradient node.

83
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,219
I will face this side and darken the outside.

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,040
I will add the next node.

85
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,599
In this node, I will reduce the gamma slightly.

86
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:24,959
I will add another node.

87
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,769
In this node, I will reduce the temperature again.

88
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,000
I will add another node.

89
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,220
In this node, I will qualify.

90
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:52,327
If I qualify here, It will select the background except the

91
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,469
subject's face .

92
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,360
I will turn off the highlight.

93
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,209
Now, I will reduce the gain fully.

94
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,680
After reducing the gain,

95
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,170
The highlighed in the face gets desolved.

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,319
I will add another node.

97
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,610
In the graph, I will link all the colors.

98
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,259
I will decrease the graph.

99
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,759
I will add another node.

100
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,470
In this node, I will go to the HDR wheels.

101
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,889
In the HDR wheels, I will adjust the global.

102
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:07,439
The reason why I adjust the global is,

103
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,430
In the primary wheels, we will use color tone for offset.

104
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,256
If we want to make it more detailed, we can use the HDR

105
00:08:13,256 --> 00:08:13,660
wheels.

106
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,030
In the HDR wheels, we will use global.

107
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,510
In the global, I will raise the point towards blue.

108
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,600
You can see the difference when I raise the point.

109
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:44,490
You can adjust the point according to your needs.

110
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:54,509
I have adjusted the global point.

111
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,948
After adjusting, I will decrease the exposure option which

112
00:08:57,948 --> 00:08:58,730
is down here.

113
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:04,445
You can see the video becomes darker when I decrease the

114
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:04,899
exposure.

115
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,740
I will also decrease the saturation.

116
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,299
I will add the next node.

117
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,190
In this node, I will go to maskings.

118
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,039
I will use the pen tool.

119
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:35,220
I will draw the highlight points.

120
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:47,989
Increase the softness after the rough draw

121
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,680
I will adjust the feather rate inside.

122
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,480
I will go to the primary wheels and decrease the gain.

123
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,717
I will turn it off and show you the difference between the

124
00:10:10,717 --> 00:10:12,909
previous and the current one.

125
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,679
When you are tracking, you have to do it frame by frame.

126
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,539
If you give auto-track, it may collapse.

127
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,279
I will add the next node again.

128
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,811
In the 24th node, I am going to reduce the Highlight and

129
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:35,699
Saturation in the Primary Wheels.

130
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,769
First I will reduce the Highlight.

131
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:51,270
Then I will reduce the Saturation.

132
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,569
Don't reduce the Saturation too much, just reduce it

133
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:55,009
slightly.

134
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:01,487
The reason why I have reduced the Saturation in the video

135
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:04,005
is, the color of the night will always be considered as

136
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:04,279
grey.

137
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,679
In the night mode, the color of the night is grey, not blue.

138
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:13,358
So to give a grey feel, if we dissolve all the colors, we

139
00:11:13,358 --> 00:11:14,689
will get a grey feel.

140
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,159
I will add next node again.

141
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,139
In this, I will go to Blur and reduce the Radius.

142
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,580
I have reduced it to 0.4.

143
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,610
I will add the next node.

144
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,719
In this node, I will reduce the Color Boost in the Primary

145
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:40,149
Wheels.

146
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,342
When we reduce the Color Boost, we have to slightly

147
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:48,463
decrease the color of the major color we have ruled in the

148
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:48,840
video.

149
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,330
Day for Night has been completed.

150
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,690
Let's see the difference.

151
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:01,289
I will keep it on full screen.

152
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,039
This is the log footage.

153
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,299
And this is Day for Night.

154
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:12,279
In this footage, Day for Night is not proper.

155
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:15,337
If we want Day for Night to be proper, we have to shoot in

156
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:16,139
pre-production.

157
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,318
If you shoot in the place where the Highlight is less, you

158
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:21,000
can shoot Day for Night easily.
