00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,160
Chapter 7.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,777
Let's see how to grade both low light and without light

3
00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:08,369
footage.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,010
If you don't have a proper light footage, you will

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,169
definitely get grains.

6
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:15,730
Let's mash those grains and see how to grade them properly.

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,000
And let's see how the RGB mixer works.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You don't have to add much contrast in low light footage.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,269
I'm adding a little bit of contrast.

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,000
Then I'm spreading the gamma a little bit.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,079
I'm raising the gain in the 3rd node.

12
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:36,134
After raising the gain in the 3rd node, you can see a lot

13
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:37,509
of grains in that footage.

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,240
Grains.

15
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:44,740
I'm adding the 4th node.

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,190
We can grade the basic and then remove the grains.

17
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,130
I'm increasing the saturation.

18
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,740
Similarly, I'm reducing it in the 4th node.

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,759
I'm adjusting the white balance in the next node.

20
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:04,544
After white balance, I'm changing the dark blue tones in

21
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:05,760
the background.

22
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to the color wrapper and picking this color.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,659
I'm changing the hue.

24
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,129
This is greenish.

25
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:15,519
This is better for me.

26
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,379
I'm adding it in the next node.

27
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,400
Now.

28
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:24,679
Now I'm qualifying the face.

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,019
I'm picking the qualifier.

30
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,230
I'm changing the hue.

31
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,099
I'm qualifying the face.

32
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,000
After qualifying the face, I'm raising the gain in it.

33
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,490
The face got bright after editing.

34
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,599
I'm adding the next node.

35
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,210
In this node, there is a tool called motion effects next to

36
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,080
the RGB mixer.

37
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,045
If you raise the luma in this tool, all the grains will get

38
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:02,430
mash.

39
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:06,019
I'm zooming in the footage and increasing the luma.

40
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:10,769
When I increase the luma, all the grains will be removed.

41
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:13,000
But the face will get affected too

42
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm adding the next node.

43
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:18,039
I'm setting the radius to 0.45.

44
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,752
If I didn't set the radius in this node, his face would be

45
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:24,259
blurred.

46
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:27,259
But because I set the radius, his eyes look sharp.

47
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,759
I'm adjusting the radius to 0.43.

48
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:36,713
Because we applied luma in this footage, we controlled all

49
00:02:36,713 --> 00:02:37,479
these grains.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,759
This is how much the grains are.

51
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,370
This is how much we controlled.

52
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:48,118
If there are grains in any footage you're grading, increase

53
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:50,590
the luma and control the radius.

54
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,169
Next, let's see how the RGB mixer works.

55
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:55,849
There is a RGB mixer tool next to the motion effects.

56
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,000
If you go into that tool, there are 3 color outputs.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,490
Red, Green and Blue.

58
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,409
As I said in the beginning, to fix a color tone, you just

59
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,373
need to decrease the opposite color to the color tone you

60
00:03:07,373 --> 00:03:07,790
choose.

61
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,340
The color tone you choose will start to rule.

62
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:13,449
I'm reducing the red output in the 12th node.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,058
When I reduce the red output in the 12th node, the green

64
00:03:18,058 --> 00:03:19,289
started to rule.

65
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,949
I've controlled the red in this node.

66
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:26,477
Because I controlled the red, the green flavor is slightly

67
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:27,000
added here.

68
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,120
I'll disable it and show you.

69
00:03:31,649 --> 00:03:34,729
The first one was slightly red in the face and subject.

70
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:37,677
Now, because I reduced the red output, the green tone is

71
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:38,729
slightly increased.

72
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,748
Similarly, to fix a color tone, you just need to decrease

73
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:43,750
the opposite color to the color tone you choose.

74
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,000
The color tone you choose will start to rule.
