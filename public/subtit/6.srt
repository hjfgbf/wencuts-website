00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,999
Chapter 6

2
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:06,750
Magic Masking and the Keyframes. Let's see how to do it.

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,015
I have already imported a footage. I will go to the other

4
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:10,349
page.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,230
As usual, I will do the basic grade first.

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,393
I have done the basic grade in this video. Let's see how to

7
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:28,640
do the magic mask in this.

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,000
I will add a fresh node.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,780
After adding it,

10
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:38,370
There is a tool called magic masking near the tracker.

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,109
Click on it.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,167
Before drawing the magic masking, check if your video is in

13
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,079
the first frame.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,715
I will change it to better here. I will draw a rough

15
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,320
diagram on the subject.

16
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,288
Every sketch we do one by one will be considered as a

17
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:01,140
single strokes.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,801
I have drawn a rough diagram on the subject. Let's do

19
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:08,980
forward tracking on it.

20
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:12,822
After drawing, click on the forward tracking option. The

21
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,129
video will start tracking forward.

22
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,120
It will take some time, but the result will be better.

23
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,034
As soon as the magic masking is tracked, we can check the

24
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:32,000
highlight in the power window.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,799
I will turn on the highlight now.

26
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,267
When I turn on the highlight, I can clearly see the edges

27
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:38,000
of the subject.

28
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,000
I will increase the radius now.

29
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,744
When I increase the radius, the feather rate will increase

30
00:01:43,744 --> 00:01:44,750
in the subject.

31
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:51,560
The magic masking is used to separate the subject and to

32
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,469
animate the subject.

33
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,121
I will right click on the magic masking and connect it to

34
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:58,060
the alpha output.

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,170
I will go back to the edit page and duplicate this clip.

36
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,304
I have turned off the magic masking node in the first layer

37
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:08,879
of the video.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,870
I have turned it on in the second layer only.

39
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,104
What we insert in between the first and second layers will

40
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:16,000
be reflected in the second layer.

41
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:19,419
I have the full video in the first layer and the alpha

42
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:21,000
output in the third layer.

43
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Let's insert a text in the second layer.

44
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,060
I have inserted a basic text.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,610
I will type Wencuts.

46
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:40,233
We have inserted the text behind the third layer of the

47
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:40,949
alpha output.

48
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:43,689
This text will be in the background of the subject.

49
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,736
Not only that, you can also lighten the subject that has

50
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:55,750
been magic masked.

51
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:00,469
I will increase the temperature now.

52
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,633
The temperature I have increased will be reflected in the

53
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:07,000
subject.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,199
We don't have to do anything in the magic masking.

55
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,340
We just have to roughly draw the subject.

56
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,340
Next, let's look at the keyframes.

57
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,310
I will select the keyframe tool.

58
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:17,069
I will add a new node.

59
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,539
I am now in the 12th node.

60
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,229
The nodes are in the keyframes will shown as corrector.

61
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,419
I am now going to key the 12th corrector.

62
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,970
In this video, I will add a key to the 12th corrector in

63
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:32,789
the first frame.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I will add a key and increase the gain slightly.

65
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,000
The first key have been added.

66
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,258
I am going to add another key in the middle of this video

67
00:03:40,258 --> 00:03:41,220
to reduce the gain.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,108
Now, when I play the video, the range that I have set

69
00:03:46,108 --> 00:03:48,689
before the video travels from here to here.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,739
That is, from the first frame, until I set the next

71
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:54,479
keyframe, the colour will travel and be completed.

72
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,345
The reason why I use these keyframes is if you go from the

73
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:00,048
room to the outdoor, it will be dark in the indoor and

74
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:01,199
bright in the outdoor.

75
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,801
Before going from the indoor to the outdoor, this keyframe

76
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:05,000
is used for color changing.

77
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:07,289
There is another way to use this keyframe.

78
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,379
I will tell you that too.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,819
First, I will go to the power window.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,150
I will select a rectangle in the power window.

81
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,321
I will cover the rectangle so that the video is fully

82
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:17,800
spread.

83
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,390
In the rectangle power window that I selected,

84
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,690
I will set all the feathers to 0.

85
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,930
Go to soft,

86
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,040
Set here as 0.

87
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:36,529
Now all the edges will be dark.

88
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:39,789
In the first frame, I will add a keyframe like this.

89
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,759
In the middle of the video,

90
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,170
I will make sure that it is fully covered.

91
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:53,769
Now in the video,

92
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:56,263
I will raise the temperature in the first keyframe I set,

93
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:58,719
but I will not do anything in the middle of the keyframe.

94
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,976
The temperature that I set first will travel to the middle

95
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:04,139
of the frame through this power window.

96
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:10,420
Now let's see.

97
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,271
The window that I set first will travel to the middle of

98
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:14,819
the frame.

99
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,393
With this power window and keyframes, you can design your

100
00:05:18,393 --> 00:05:19,819
video according to your sense.

101
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,579
Chapter 6 is completed with this.

102
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:24,300
In Chapter 7, let's see how to do low light grading.
