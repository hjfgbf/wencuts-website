00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi, so far we have seen about tools from chapter 1 to 8.

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,899
In the next class, we will see how to completely grade a

3
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:13,369
video.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,411
The first thing I teach you about tools is that, before you

5
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:21,000
grade a video, you need to know how to use the tools.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,426
Only then you will know which tools to use to adjust a

7
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,000
video.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,719
I will show you how to grade a footage using the tools from

9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,000
chapter 1 to 8.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,649
I have already opened it.

11
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:39,670
I have already put the footages in individual folders.

12
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,309
Indoor Daylight and Indoor Nightlight. I have four folders

13
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,000
like this.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,460
I will show you one by one.

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,159
Let's start with Outdoor Daylight.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,000
I will drag this footage and put it here.

17
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:00,840
I will remove the audio.

18
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,269
In this clip, I will cut the necessary places.

19
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:09,000
Then I will cut it at the end.

20
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,599
I will go to the cover page.

21
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,290
As I said in the first class, the layout will be like this.

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,680
First, we will grade a basic.

23
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:26,859
I will right click and go to add node and add serial node.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,430
I will reduce the lift here.

25
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,000
Then I will add the next node.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,640
I will right click and go to add node and add serial.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,269
In Mac, you can use the option edge.

28
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,000
In Windows, you can use the alt edge to add serial node.

29
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,450
I will reduce the gamma here.

30
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,930
I will add the next node.

31
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,739
I will increase the gain.

32
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,209
When I increase the gain, I will open the waveform.

33
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:05,930
It should not be more than 1023.

34
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,079
The reason why it should not be more than 1023 is that, the

35
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:11,520
left side of the video has too many highlights.

36
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,050
So, it's showing like that.

37
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:16,349
Let's keep it as it is.

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,990
I will add the next node.

39
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,389
Add serial node.

40
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,000
Now, I will bring the saturation in the video.

41
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,520
As I said in the first class, we can increase the

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,979
saturation in two nodes.

43
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,699
Let's reduce the saturation in the last node.

44
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,000
This is the basic grid in the video.

45
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,899
Now, I will increase the contrast.

46
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:50,960
Here it is.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,159
I have increased the contrast.

48
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:58,622
When I increase the contrast, the subject and the

49
00:02:58,622 --> 00:03:00,460
background will separate.

50
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:05,306
If It is faded, when I increase the contrast, the subject

51
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:08,000
and the background will separate.

52
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,389
I will add the next node.

53
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,240
I will reduce the saturation.

54
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:21,479
I will add the next node again.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,610
You can add each node for each step.

56
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,090
Then, we will know which node is correct.

57
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,390
I will reduce the temperature.

58
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,919
I will add the next node again.

59
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,250
I am going to change this video to a rustic village color.

60
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:50,200
The rustic village color will be warm, dark and contrasty.

61
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,140
Let's change it to rustic village color.

62
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:54,789
I have not reduced the temperature in the first node.

63
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:57,389
I will increase the temperature in the next node.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,719
I have increased the temperature to a warm tone.

65
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,099
I will add the next node again.

66
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:10,129
I will add the serial node.

67
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,389
I am going to qualify the face.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,819
You can use color slice instead of qualifying.

69
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:22,799
As I said in the first video, we use color slice to select

70
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:26,779
the skin tones or to select the greens in the background.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,449
How does this work?

72
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,590
I have the skin option here.

73
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,509
If I turn on the highlight, it will pick the skin tone.

74
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,780
This is optional.

75
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,500
If you don't want to use color slice, you can use qualify.

76
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,129
I am going to use qualify for now.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,779
I am going to turn on the highlight.

78
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:47,819
I am going to qualify.

79
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,060
I am going to add the qualifier.

80
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,240
I will qualify the remaining.

81
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,209
I am going to increase the blur radius.

82
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,110
I am going to increase the pre-filter.

83
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,879
I am going to turn off the highlight.

84
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:11,788
I am going to increase the gain in this portion where I

85
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:12,420
qualified.

86
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:19,949
I have increased the gain.

87
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,019
After increasing the gain,

88
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:23,259
I am going to decrease the mid value.

89
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,259
This is to make the skin smoother.

90
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,579
I am going to add the next node.

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,769
The next step is to fix the color tone.

92
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,829
I told you about a rustic color.

93
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:40,119
After fixing the color tone, we can do masking or anything

94
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,459
else.

95
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,699
I am going to graph for tone fixing.

96
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:46,420
I am going to select the hue.

97
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,000
I am going to select the hue and pick the green.

98
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,399
I get this point tone.

99
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,399
If I drag this point, the color of the tree will change.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I will keep the tone as it is.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Since it is rustic,

102
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,329
I am going to make the leaves brownish.

103
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,720
I am going to add the next node.

104
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:14,043
What we are going to do now is we are going to add a

105
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:15,110
parallel node here.

106
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,000
What is a parallel node?

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,540
I am going to change the color tone throughout this video.

108
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,930
I am going to pick a leaf and change the color.

109
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,000
I am going to pick their skin tone and change the color.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,259
I am going to pick their dress and change the color.

111
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,759
We have to do everything like an overlay.

112
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,639
I am going to add a parallel node.

113
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,180
I will add a new node.

114
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,482
When we add a parallel node, it will be a first layer,

115
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:45,490
second layer and third layer.

116
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:48,100
All three will be considered as one node.

117
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,290
But we can apply color layer by layer.

118
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,329
First, I have adjusted the leaf.

119
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:57,540
Second, I am going to adjust the skin tone.

120
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:01,030
While adjusting the skin tone, we can go to the vectorscope.

121
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,300
We can check the skin tone here.

122
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,819
There will be an indicator here.

123
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,270
If you don't see this indicator, you can go to the settings.

124
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,000
There is an option called show skin tone indicator.

125
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:14,330
If you turn it on, you will see an indicator here.

126
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,490
I will show you.

127
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,420
Do you see the skin tone indicator here?

128
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,000
Do you see the skin tone indicator?

129
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,079
There is a waveform here.

130
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,680
This waveform should be above the line.

131
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,870
Only then the skin tone will be correct.

132
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,000
You can adjust it slightly below or above.

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,620
That is not a problem.

134
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,069
This is because we all use cine lens.

135
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,560
We use Nikon, Sony,

136
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,000
Canon, Sigma, etc.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We use a variation of lens.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
In one lens, the tint is on the green side.

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,240
In another lens, the tint is on the pink side.

140
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,477
If there is a variation in the lens, the skin tone will be

141
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:48,980
damaged.

142
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,759
That is not a problem.

143
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,139
You can adjust it by looking at the vectorscope.

144
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:55,389
In the 13th node,

145
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:58,420
I will go to hue vs saturation.

146
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:00,310
I will pick the skin tone here.

147
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,240
Can you see the dot, I will drag this out.

148
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,420
If you drag it, the color of the face will change.

149
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,230
I will keep this correctly.

150
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:17,000
I will drag it and reduce the redness.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,079
The face will look red.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,670
I will reduce the redness.

153
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:26,340
If you want, you can adjust it in the already qualified

154
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,800
node.

155
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,180
I will click on the 14th parallel node.

156
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,429
I will go to curves custom.

157
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,899
I will choose white.

158
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,759
I will adjust the luminance

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I have adjusted it.

160
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:44,159
Now I will

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,838
Now I will right click on the parallel mixer, add node and

162
00:08:53,838 --> 00:08:55,159
add it to the serial node.

163
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,290
Now I will add masking to this node.

164
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,820
First I will choose a circle.

165
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,800
I will increase the feather rate.

166
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,080
I will increase the gain in the mask.

167
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:25,599
I will increase the gain in the mask.

168
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,429
I will turn it off.

169
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,340
You can see the difference between before and after.

170
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,940
I will add the next node again.

171
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,030
I will choose the same circle this time also.

172
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:46,110
I will make it so that the entire video is covered.

173
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:52,779
I will increase the feather rate.

174
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,480
I will invert this mask.

175
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,740
To make it feel like a vintage look.

176
00:09:58,049 --> 00:09:59,809
I am going to primary wheels.

177
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,179
I'm adjusting gamma and gain

178
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,778
I'm turning it off to see the difference between before and

179
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:11,269
after giving vintage feel.

180
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,639
I'm adding next node again

181
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,169
I'm going back to masking

182
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,000
This time I'm using the pen tool

183
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm using the pen tool

184
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:22,000
I told you in the first class

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,970
Light should be brighter on the side where the light travels

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And darker on the side where there are more shadows

187
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,267
I'm going to form a triangle from the side where there are

188
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:32,000
more shadows

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,960
This is to show that the light travels from this side

190
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:37,740
I'm zooming in

191
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm forming a triangle

192
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,490
You can see this triangle in most of the Hollywood movies

193
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:48,019
Their lighting will be like this

194
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:49,490
This is called a loop light

195
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,000
There will be light on one side of the face

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,120
And on the other side, there will be some fills

197
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,220
I'm increasing the feather rate of the triangle

198
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,409
I'm keeping it off

199
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,560
I will keep it on the outside

200
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,000
What I'm doing now

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,309
I'm increasing the gain of this triangle

202
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,080
This is to highlight the light that travels from this side

203
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,159
I'm turning it off to see the difference

204
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,000
Now you can see

205
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,750
You can see the difference between before and now

206
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:23,719
I'm adding the next node again

207
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,000
In this node

208
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,269
I'm going to add a gradient node

209
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:32,210
To the darker side

210
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:34,519
I've chosen the gradient node

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,870
I'm keeping the arrow mark on this side

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,570
I'm not placing it from the side

213
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,720
I'm placing it from a little above

214
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,759
As if it's crossed

215
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,000
Because the shadows are more in the head

216
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,730
So I'm turning it off

217
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,199
I'm reducing the gain

218
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,519
See the difference between before and now

219
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,009
I'm adding the next node again.

220
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,389
What I'm going to do in this node

221
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,500
I'm going to reduce the red in the frame

222
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,230
I told you to do it in offset to fix a color tone

223
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,960
But if you reduce a single color like this

224
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,870
You can do it in lift or gamma

225
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,299
I'm doing it in gamma

226
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,169
I'm decreasing the red

227
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,679
When you decrease it

228
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,789
You will see a good change

229
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,000
Between before and now

230
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,779
The red in the trees

231
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,759
And the red in the building

232
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,039
I dissolves all of this

233
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,899
Can you see the difference?

234
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,950
I'm adding the serial node again

235
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,600
I'm increasing the sharpness in this node

236
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,610
I'm going to the blur

237
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,510
I'm increasing the radius to 0.48

238
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:10,309
I've already told you why I'm increasing the sharpness

239
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:12,369
You can see the difference here

240
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,870
Look at the eyes properly

241
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,269
Note this area.

242
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,230
Now it's a blur

243
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,370
After adjusting it, it's a little sharper

244
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:26,469
I'm adding the next node again

245
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,080
What I'm going to do in this node

246
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,060
I'm going to increase the warmth

247
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,149
I'm increasing the temperature

248
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,549
It's a little bluish here

249
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,570
After increasing the temperature

250
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,090
The pattern is fixed

251
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,050
I'm adding the next node again

252
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,440
What I'm going to do in this node

253
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,580
In masking

254
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:57,679
I'm choosing a round

255
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,230
I'm going to darken this side

256
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:03,799
I'm pointing it here

257
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,099
I'm increasing the feather rate

258
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:22,779
Now I'm going to reduce the gain in the primary wheels

259
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,530
You can see the difference

260
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,169
I've already raised the gain in the triangle

261
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:33,639
I can raise it a little more

262
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,539
I can raise the gain a little more

263
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,009
I've added a pinch

264
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,800
I'm going back to the qualify node

265
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,769
I'm raising the gain a little more in her face

266
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,070
I've raised the gain

267
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,840
You can see the elevation on the subject and background

268
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,940
I'm adding the next node again

269
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:13,199
What I'm going to do in this node

270
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:14,579
I'm going to use qualify

271
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,810
I'm going to see if I can separate something in the

272
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,459
background

273
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,669
I'm going to pin this first

274
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,240
Turning on the lightning

275
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:26,060
It got pined in the highlighted place.

276
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,019
I'm increasing the blur radius

277
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:31,120
After increasing it,

278
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,970
I'm reducing the saturation here

279
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,509
I'm reducing the saturation in the highlights.

280
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:43,000
When I reduce it, it will match the rustic color

281
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,689
I'm turning off the highlight and disabling it

282
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:47,699
It will be a small difference

283
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,679
If we do it more precisely,

284
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,669
It will be a nice look when you see it fully

285
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:54,639
I'm adding the next node again

286
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:58,269
I'm going to qualify this highlight

287
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:00,449
I'm going to turning on the highlight

288
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,460
I'm qualifying this

289
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,549
I'm increasing the blur radius

290
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,860
I'm clicking the pre filter.

291
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,169
I'm turning off the highlight

292
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,559
I'm going to add glow in this node

293
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:19,189
I'm going to search for glow in the effects

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm going to tract the glow

295
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:25,210
after that, I'm setting the shine threshold to 1000

296
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,779
I'm increasing the spread value

297
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,200
I'm showing before and after difference

298
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,600
Look at this

299
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,370
If there is a highlight, we got the highlighted details

300
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:39,529
SO our video is looking even better

301
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,249
I'm adding the next node again

302
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,399
I am turning off the effects

303
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,099
See the difference

304
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:52,071
In that node, we reduced the saturation in the building and

305
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:53,639
highlights In quantified image,

306
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,199
In qualified image, Gamma would be reduced

307
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,000
Gamma will separate the backgrounds from the main subject

308
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,279
You can see the difference

309
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,980
I will add a new node

310
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,870
I'm adding the serial node

311
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,540
I will calibrate the skin tone again

312
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,617
In skin tone, there are multiple colors like yellow, pink

313
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:22,190
and red

314
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,860
We have to correct all these

315
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,720
I will choose the qualifier again

316
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,980
I will turn on the highlight

317
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,079
I will qualify the face

318
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,170
I will choose the add qualifier again

319
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,980
I will increase the blur radius

320
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,150
I will increase the blur radius

321
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,440
In this node,

322
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,720
In the graph,

323
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,130
I am going to Hue Vs sat, by pinning this area

324
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,769
I am going to desaturation

325
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:23,319
If you look at it now, the pink and red is dissolved in the

326
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:23,730
face

327
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,529
First, it is more pink in this area

328
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,690
now it is dissolved now, I am adding the next node

329
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,639
In this node,

330
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:37,559
I am going to sat Vs sat

331
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,589
pick the skin tone

332
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:43,150
I am raising the pinned area

333
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:53,769
I will get a blush in the skin tone

334
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:56,960
What I am going to do is.

335
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
We did so many maskings

336
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,350
I am going to adjust the masking again

337
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,420
I am going to reduce the gamma in this masking

338
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:24,619
I am going to reduce the gamma in this node

339
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:26,880
I am going to reduce the gamma in this node too

340
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,560
Here too

341
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,690
Now everything fixed, I am going to add a new series node

342
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,980
In this node, I am going to use the color slice

343
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,980
Let me turn on the highlight first

344
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,810
I am going to pick the Blue

345
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:48,269
In this video, all the places I have picked are blue

346
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We do not need major blue in rustic village color

347
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,069
So I am reducing the saturation

348
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
This is saturation and this is density

349
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,710
You can even change the hue of this

350
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:04,970
They have also given us an option to adjust the radius

351
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,789
When we adjust the this, the radius will also adjust

352
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,120
I will keep it in the center again

353
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,329
I have reduced the saturation

354
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,400
I have now turned off the highlight

355
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:18,950
If we look at the difference

356
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:22,159
Her hair has a little bit of blue

357
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,370
Her hair has a little bit of blue

358
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,109
After adjusting it, the blue in her hair has disappeared

359
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,159
Colors like this are only used for this

360
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,160
If there is any color in the video that is in the height

361
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,160
We can use this to find it

362
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,460
I will add on the next node

363
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,650
I am going to qualify in this node again

364
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I will turn on the highlight

365
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,480
I am going to qualify all these trees

366
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,400
I am going to choose the minus qualifier

367
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,150
I am minusing the highlighted character

368
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,000
I am going to turn off the highlight

369
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,710
After turning off the highlight

370
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,370
I am going to adjust the temperature of the primary wheels

371
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,000
I am going to raise the temperature

372
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,330
I am adjusting the temperature because

373
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,759
I want to get a warm feeling in the background

374
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,200
First it was a little bit blueish

375
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,920
Now after adjusting it, it has increased a little bit

376
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:43,809
In the node where we adjusted the glow

377
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,099
We can increase the saturation

378
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,450
We can use the saturation option here

379
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:51,630
We can also choose the color in the glow

380
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:52,789
If I keep it red

381
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,759
From the place where I qualified the glow

382
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:56,539
It will be a little bit red

383
00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:02,309
So overall we have graded the video

384
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,000
In the vector scope also

385
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
We have the correct color in the radius

386
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,990
In the vector scope, if we have all the colors in the radius

387
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,200
It means that the color is proper in the video

388
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,509
Now we have graded the video

389
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:14,700
I will show the difference

390
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:16,219
This is the log footage

391
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:18,259
And this is the color graded

392
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,829
We should never over-contrast in a video

393
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:22,829
What will happen is

394
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,960
When we see it on a big screen

395
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,750
It will be imamatured

396
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:27,250
Now I am going to show you the tools

397
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,240
From chapter 1 to 8

398
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,720
I will use those tools and grade the video

399
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:34,500
Until you know how to use those tools

400
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,549
Go through those 8 chapters
