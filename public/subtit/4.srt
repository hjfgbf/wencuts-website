00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:05,070
Skin Calibrating and Qualifying

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,769
Why do we use Qualifying?

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,320
We use Qualifier for all single color patterns

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,929
When we use Qualifier for all single color patterns

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,000
That pattern will be shown as Qualifier

6
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:15,640
Now let's see how

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I have already imported a footage

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,000
I will add it personally

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,280
I will give a basic grade

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,520
I have fixed a basic color tone as usual

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,340
Now let's see how to use Qualifier

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,000
I will add a new node

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,571
In this, there is an option called Qualifier near the power

14
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:56,000
window

15
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:58,539
Go inside and select this pin

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,259
Select this pin

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,939
If you point at the skin tone

18
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,469
It will pick the skin tone

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,430
If you want to see it clearly

20
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,370
Highlight it

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,070
After Highlighting

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,710
It will show the patches in skin tone

23
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,689
To clear this

24
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:16,409
There is a plus Qualifier

25
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:17,659
Choose that

26
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,730
After choosing, remove the paches

27
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,450
Now I have qualified the face oh the subject

28
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,109
But there are patches

29
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:31,490
Let's see how to clear this

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,439
In that Qualifier tool

31
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,439
There is an option called Blur Radius

32
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,829
Keep it at 100

33
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:40,150
After keeping it at 100

34
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,890
There is an option called Pre-Filter

35
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,329
Raise it a little

36
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,939
What Pre-Filter does is

37
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,189
It will clear all the pointed patches

38
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:51,599
Blur Radius is used to soften the edges

39
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:54,000
I am going to use Gain and Shadows

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,370
To calibrate the portion I qualified

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,980
First, I will raise the Gain

42
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:00,359
Then, I will raise the Shadow

43
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,280
There is a yellow light in the subject face

44
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,659
To clear that

45
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,659
We can reduce the Temperature and Saturation

46
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:17,699
We can turn off the Highlight

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,250
After turning it off

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,990
Look at the before and after

49
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,439
How the skin tone is calibrated

50
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:25,931
Now, we can clear the pores and pimples in the subject's

51
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:26,219
skin

52
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,000
In Primary Wheels

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,259
There is an option called Mid Details

54
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
If you keep it at minus, it will become soft

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,669
If you keep it at plus, it will become sharp

56
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,750
Let's keep it at minus 35

57
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,000
After smoothening the skin

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,080
The details in the subject's face will blend

59
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,650
So we have to add sharpness to this

60
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,839
I will add a new node

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,060
Let's go to Blur

62
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,639
After going to blur,

63
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,500
If the Radius is 0.47

64
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,879
We have to add texture to where it is blended

65
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,360
I will show you closely

66
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,319
Look at the difference

67
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,200
Before adding the Radius

68
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,430
After adding the Radius

69
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,079
If you don't add the Radius, it will be smooth

70
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:10,579
If you add the Radius, the skin will have this texture

71
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:13,199
In this footage, we have selected the subject's face

72
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,219
Qualified it

73
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,599
And done the shin calibrating too

74
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,180
In this graded footage,

75
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,669
To identify if the Highlight and Colors are correct

76
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:20,449
Let's check the Scope

77
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:22,679
I will open the Waveform in Scopes

78
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,000
In Waveform, the Highlight should not go above 1023

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,419
And the Shadows should not come below 768

80
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,589
The attribution of waveform is

81
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:31,589
In a video, If the Highlight is more on this side

82
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:32,639
And the Shadow is on the other side

83
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,509
The Waveform will be similar to that.

84
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:37,169
In Waveform, the Highlight will be more on the left side

85
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:38,739
And the Shadows will be more on the right side

86
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,739
To check if the Saturation is correct

87
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:41,599
Let's use the Parade

88
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,530
The Parade should not go above 1023 and the Shadows should

89
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,489
not come below 768

90
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,830
In Parade, the Red, Green and Blue

91
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,000
Did not go above 1023 and the Shadows did not come below 768

92
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,379
In this footage, the Highlight and Colors are correct

93
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,299
The 4th Chapter is completed

94
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:00,129
In the upcoming Chapter, we will see further
