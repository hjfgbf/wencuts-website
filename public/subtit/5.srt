1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,380
In Chapter 5

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,681
we are going to see how to use Color Wrapper and Color

3
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:08,109
Graph.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,000
Before that, let's grade this video as usual.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,140
I'll adjust Lift, Gamma, and raise the Gain.

6
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:27,989
Then I'll increase Saturation in 2 nodes and decrease in 1

7
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:28,419
node.

8
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:33,019
Then I'll adjust White Balance.

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,340
Now I've got a basic grade.

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,910
After getting a basic color, we can go to Color Wrapper and

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,000
change the color.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,770
We can also go to Graph and change it.

13
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:44,479
Now I'm in Color Graph.

14
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,799
In Graph, we can link RGB and work.

15
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,382
Or if you want Red, Green, or Blue separately, you can

16
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:52,509
enable that too.

17
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:53,719
I'll link it.

18
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:55,869
We can adjust Contrast in Graph.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,679
You can adjust it if you need to.

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,000
I didn't adjust Contrast here.

21
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,629
I'll go to Hue Graph.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,840
Now I'll pin this violet color.

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,079
After pinning this violet, I'll get 3 points here.

24
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:14,689
The black point in the center is our pinning color.

25
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:17,120
When I adjust this, the hue will also change.

26
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,329
I'll change that violet color to blue.

27
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,969
I've changed it.

28
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:23,250
I'll add the next note.

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,250
I'll pick this green.

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,160
I've got the pinning point again.

31
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,530
I'll adjust this.

32
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,627
When I adjust this pinning point, the green leaves in the

33
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,000
back will change to brown.

34
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,450
I'll add the next note again.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,189
I'll pick this green.

36
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,980
I'll change the hue in this.

37
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:49,294
Now we've pinned all the green leaves in the back and

38
00:01:49,294 --> 00:01:50,349
changed the color.

39
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll add the next node.

40
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:54,000
Or I'll go to Saturation.

41
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:59,000
In Saturation, the color we pin and rise will rise.

42
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,700
Now I'll pin this green and rise it.

43
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,670
If you look at this display, the green will adjust.

44
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll add the next note again.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In this node, I'm going to adjust Hue vs Luminance.

46
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,120
I'm pinning this green.

47
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:19,524
When I pin and raise the color in the back, the Luminance

48
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:21,000
in the hue will increase.

49
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,930
But I don't need it right now, so I'll do it for you.

50
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:29,095
You can see in the display, the Luminance in the hue will

51
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:29,500
increase.

52
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll reset it.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,300
Next graph, Luminance vs Saturation.

54
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,000
How this graph works is,

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll increase the Saturation in Luminance.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,360
I'll select Luminance.

57
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:44,073
If I rise the pinning point, the blue light in the

58
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:46,000
highlight will increase.

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,770
I'll zoom in.

60
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,533
As you can see, the blue light in the highlight has

61
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:54,000
increased.

62
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:56,580
Next graph, Saturation vs Saturation.

63
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,000
This graph prioritizes the red value.

64
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,759
I'll add the next node.

65
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,199
I'll pin her face.

66
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,774
If I pin and raise her face, the red value in her face will

67
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,379
increase.

68
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:13,830
I don't need this now.

69
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll add the next note.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,409
Saturation vs Luminance.

71
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:21,043
This graph is used to increase and decrease the Luminance

72
00:03:21,043 --> 00:03:22,000
in Saturation.

73
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll pin the blue color.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,289
If I pin and rise the blue color, the Luminance in

75
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,000
Saturation will increase.

76
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,490
I'll reset it.

77
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,539
I'll add the next node.

78
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,890
Now I'll upgrade the video.

79
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,129
First I'll pick the qualifier.

80
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:42,490
Then I'll qualify your face.

81
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:44,520
I'll turn on the highlight.

82
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll add Blur Radius.

83
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll turn on the pre-filter.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,656
Now I'll increase the Gain and Shadows in the node I

85
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:58,430
qualified.

86
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,810
I'll turn off the highlight again.

87
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,229
Now I'll reduce the mid-value in her face.

88
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:13,199
Now I'll add a fresh node and reduce the Blur Radius.

89
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll keep it at 0.48.

90
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,129
Then I'll add another fresh node.

91
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,430
Now I'll mask this.

92
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,120
I'll select Gradient Masking.

93
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll face this gradient power window on the right side.

94
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,170
I'll reduce the gamma in this.

95
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,000
Then I'll add the next node.

96
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,689
I'll choose another power window in the circle.

97
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,540
I'll track her face.

98
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,000
As I said earlier, I'll track forward and backward.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll increase the gamma in the power window I added.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Now let's see the difference in this video.

101
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,012
This is the log footage and this is the color graded

102
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:16,339
footage.

103
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,855
In this video, we can do the same thing we did in the graph

104
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:20,689
in Color Wrapper.

105
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:21,680
I'll tell you how to do that too.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,279
There will be a Color Wrapper next to the Qualifier.

107
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:25,560
I'll go into that.

108
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,586
After selecting this, I'll get a qualifying pin when I

109
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:29,569
enter the display.

110
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:32,000
I can use that pin to choose any color I want.

111
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,730
I'll choose blue.

112
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:38,090
Once you pin blue, you will have the option to control Hue,

113
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,769
Saturation and Luminance.

114
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:44,000
I can control Hue, Saturation and Luminance in this.

115
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,180
I'll change the color in the Wrapper to sky blue.

116
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,209
I'll increase the Saturation.

117
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,629
And I'll increase the Luminance.

118
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,936
Now you can see the difference between the Graph and the

119
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:03,379
Wrapper.

120
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,810
There is a difference between the Graph and the Wrapper.

121
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,989
If you choose a color in the Graph and increase it, it will

122
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:09,959
increase sharply.

123
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,689
The only colour you have chosen.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,872
When we choose a color in the Wrapper, we choose similar

125
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:17,670
colors and increase them.

126
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,310
Chapter 5 is now complete.

127
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,860
In the next chapter, I'll introduce new tools.
