00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,000
Chapter 2

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In our last video, we saw the tools in the color page.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,451
We will see how to grade a video using those tools in the

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:10,359
coming videos.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,359
I have already imported a footage here.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,000
In color grading, our first step is to add notes.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Why do we add notes?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,817
Only when we color layer by layer, we can separate the

9
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:23,000
subject and background in the video and show it beautifully.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,074
The most important thing in this is that we should never

11
00:00:25,074 --> 00:00:26,000
color in the first note.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We always add a note and start grading from there.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If we want to delete a color, we can delete it.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,164
In the first step, I am going to raise the contrast in the

15
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:34,500
grading.

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,657
In log footage, the shadows are always filled to make it

17
00:00:37,657 --> 00:00:38,259
look flat.

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,099
So when we raise the contrast, the subject and background

19
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:42,270
will be elevated first.

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,000
I will now raise the contrast in the lift.

21
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,340
I have kept it at minus till now.

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
I will now add the second note again.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,250
I will add the same serial note with the add note.

24
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:56,679
Next, I will reduce the gamma.

25
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,000
I will keep the gamma at minus.

26
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,660
Why do I adjust the lift and gamma?

27
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:03,189
In the previous video, I told you that when we adjust the

28
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,329
lift, it will be sharper.

29
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,000
When we adjust the gamma, the feather rate will increase.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,438
When I adjust the lift in the first note and gamma in the

31
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:11,912
second note, the contrast in the video will be calibrated

32
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:12,390
correctly.

33
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,000
I have added the third note now.

34
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,319
I will reduce the lift again.

35
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:19,753
Why? I need more contrast because there are some shadows

36
00:01:19,753 --> 00:01:20,219
around.

37
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:23,900
In grading, the second step is to increase the highlight,

38
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,180
that is, adjust the exposure.

39
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,170
I will use the gain to adjust the highlight.

40
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,000
Because gain is the tool to adjust the highlight.

41
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,430
I have adjusted the gain.

42
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,430
This exposure is enough for me.

43
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,430
If I want, I can add another note and raise it.

44
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,180
I have added the next note again.

45
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,730
In grading, the third step is saturation.

46
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,350
I have kept the saturation at full in one note.

47
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,590
I will add another note in another note.

48
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:58,480
I have kept the saturation at full in this note.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,510
I will add the next note.

50
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,730
I have kept the saturation at full in this note.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,500
I will add another note again.

52
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,299
I will reduce the saturation in this note.

53
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,608
Why did I increase the saturation in two notes and reduce

54
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:12,259
the saturation in the third note?

55
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,972
I told you in the first class that saturation is always

56
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:17,000
boosted by red.

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,713
To control that red, I kept the saturation at full in two

58
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:21,169
notes.

59
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:24,108
When I reduce the saturation in the third note, the color

60
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:25,219
is easily calibrated.

61
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,680
I will add the next note.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In grading, the fourth step is WB, that is, white balance.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,692
When we do white balance in a video, it is good to watch

64
00:02:32,692 --> 00:02:33,270
that video.

65
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:34,860
I am adding a note.

66
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,270
I will decrease the temperature of this note.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,479
Now I have decreased the temperature.

68
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's see the difference between these two.

69
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,240
The video is looking yellow at first.

70
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,099
Now I will decrease the temperature and enable this note.

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,069
Now we have a similar tone in the video.

72
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,810
But this is the basic color grading.

73
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,056
Above this, there is tone fixing, masking, skin tone

74
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:00,180
calibrating, etc.

75
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,000
Now let's add the next note.

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I added another note.

77
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:07,124
In this, the primary wheels would have given us an option

78
00:03:07,124 --> 00:03:08,000
called contrast.

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,562
When I raise this, you will get a separation between the

80
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:13,280
background and foreground.

81
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:15,259
If you see now, I will disable it and show you.

82
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:16,259
Look at this.

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,933
Before adjusting the contrast, we would have had shadows in

84
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:20,479
the video.

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,087
Now if I increase the contrast, there will be a separation

86
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:24,830
between the subject and the background.

87
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:29,000
I will add the next note.

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
After adding the next note, I will go to log wheels.

89
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,580
I told you about log wheels.

90
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,870
Whichever place is darker should be over contrasted.

91
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,979
In this note, I will raise the shadows.

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,699
Now when you see, you will know the difference.

93
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,876
In the video, whichever place is darker, their hair, their

94
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:50,139
eyes, and the subjects in the background.

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,330
I will add the next note.

96
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:55,469
In this note, I am going to pick auto white balance.

97
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:58,970
If you take this qualifier and pick a place where their

98
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,452
face is yellow, the tone of the video will change

99
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:02,060
completely.

100
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,180
But using auto white balance is dangerous.

101
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,419
We can adjust it manually.

102
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,759
I will add the next note.

103
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,110
In this note, there is a tool called shadows.

104
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,240
I am going to minus this.

105
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:14,301
When I minus, what happens is, the place where the shadows

106
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,430
are already too much, will get decrease.

107
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,840
I will disable it and show you.

108
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,620
You will know this.

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,540
I have added the next note.

110
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,209
Now I am going to control the offset.

111
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,250
Offset is what I told you in the previous video.

112
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,769
It is used to change the tone of the video.

113
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,210
In a video, if we want a green tone, now usually what we do

114
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,610
is, we raise the green.

115
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,230
But in grading, we should not always raise the green.

116
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,189
For that, we have to decrease the opposite color.

117
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:41,100
When we do that, we will automatically rule the green value.

118
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,639
If you want a green tone, you have to decrease the red.

119
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,519
If you want a red tone, you have to decrease the green.

120
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,395
If you want a blue tone, you have to decrease both the red

121
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:47,879
and the green.

122
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:50,529
Now I am going to decrease the red value in that note.

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,945
When I decrease the red value, here you can see that the

124
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:56,259
green is majorly ruling.

125
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,720
So we have seen how to grade in a video.

126
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,259
But these are the basic colors.

127
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,379
Now let us see the difference between the log2 graded

128
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:03,259
footage we worked on.

129
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,220
This is the log footage.

130
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,000
And this is the basic graded.

131
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,000
That is all for the second chapter.

132
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,850
We will see further in the coming videos.
