Chapter 3

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:06,820
In the previous video, we saw how to bring log footage to a

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,440
basic grade.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,128
We can also see how to mask that graded footage using a

5
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:10,800
power window.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,000
There are three types of masking.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,869
Highlight masking, shadow masking and alpha output.

8
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:16,440
We can see all three of them now.

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,399
Now, I will add the first node and grade the base.

10
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:27,539
I have set the necessary contrast in the lift.

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,099
In the second node, I will adjust the gamma.

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,868
In the third node, I will increase the gain as we saw in

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,850
the previous video.

14
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:40,874
In the fourth node, I will decrease the saturation in the

15
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,949
third node by increasing it in the 1st 2 nodes.

16
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,787
In the fourth node, I will decrease the temperature and

17
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:49,660
white balance.

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,240
Now, we have a basic grade.

19
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:56,000
We have a basic grade from log footage.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In this video, we will see how to mask using a power window.

21
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,100
I have added the next node.

22
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,940
I will go inside the power window.

23
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:10,239
First, I will add the gradient window.

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,252
The way this window works is, the side of the arrow mark

25
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:16,950
faces.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,409
I will show you an example.

27
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,709
I will place it from this side.

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,400
I will go back to the primary wheels and reduce it.

29
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,219
I will show you the difference after reducing the gain.

30
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:36,129
I will show you an example.

31
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:48,476
If we place the gradient power window from the opposite

32
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:51,299
side of the light, it will be more effective.

33
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,520
I will add the next node.

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,510
In this node, I will add the circle window.

35
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,000
I will place it near her face.

36
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,000
I will adjust it in her face.

37
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:08,779
If you drag the point in the four corners, you can adjust

38
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:09,000
it.

39
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,009
If you drag the red dot in the circle, the feather rate

40
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,000
will increase.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If not, you can increase it here as well.

42
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,460
I adjusted it in her face.

43
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:28,629
In this node, I will increase both the gain and shadow.

44
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,839
The reason why I am increasing the shadow in this node is,

45
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,910
when we reduce the shadow, it becomes dark.

46
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,346
When we increase the shadow, it becomes brighter in darker

47
00:02:39,346 --> 00:02:39,820
places.

48
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,140
That is why I am increasing the shadow.

49
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,460
I will add the next node.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,740
In this node, I will choose the circle window again.

51
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,069
But, I am going to mask this circle window completely.

52
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:04,699
I will increase the feather rate.

53
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:07,180
Importantly, there is an option called invert.

54
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,944
If you click on it, the mask will start to fill the outer

55
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:10,710
area with color.

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,669
I have inverted it.

57
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,230
In the primary wheels, I will reduce the gamma.

58
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,000
After reducing the gamma, I will add the next node.

59
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,140
I will go back to the power window.

60
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,000
In the power window, I will choose the pen tool.

61
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:37,262
In the pen tool, I will draw the rectangle-like shadows on

62
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:38,000
the cheeks.

63
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,409
After drawing it,

64
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:47,520
I will increase the feather rate.

65
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,347
There is an option called whether the feather rate should

66
00:03:50,347 --> 00:03:51,389
come inside or outside.

67
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:52,810
If we want it outside, we can keep it outside.

68
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,150
If we want it inside, we can keep it inside.

69
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,689
I have kept it outside.

70
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,129
I will go back to the primary wheels.

71
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,729
I will reduce the gain.

72
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,949
I will add the next node again.

73
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,159
So far, we have used the masking tool in four nodes.

74
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,349
Let's disable it.

75
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,620
This is what happens when there is no masking in the video.

76
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,172
If we add masking in the video itself and control the

77
00:04:26,172 --> 00:04:28,680
highlight and shadows, the video will change like this.

78
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,000
Next, we are going to look at tracking.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Now, we have done the masking.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,839
We have to track everything.

81
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,949
So, let's go to the tracker.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,290
There is a tracker next to the power window.

83
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:42,360
First, I will choose the node that qualifies the face.

84
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,339
I have kept the video in the last frame.

85
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,620
So, I will give it a backward tracking.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,199
If you click backward tracking, it will be backward tracked.

87
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:53,569
You can see that the face is being tracked.

88
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:59,086
As the face is being tracked backward, I have to do forward

89
00:04:59,086 --> 00:04:59,649
tracking again.

90
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,649
Why? To make the tracker sharp.

91
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,110
Now, when we play it, the power window will travel with it.

92
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:27,810
I am going to track the other two nodes as well.

93
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,110
Another important thing.

94
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,014
The frame in which you are applying the power window, we

95
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:58,089
have to start tracking from that frame.

96
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,000
Otherwise, the tracking will collapse.

97
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:16,969
Now, we have tracked all the power windows that we added.

98
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:18,909
Next, let's see how the alpha output is.

99
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,879
I am in the 14th node now.

100
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,239
Again, I will choose a circle window.

101
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:27,179
I will choose it and place it near the face.

102
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,100
I will make the feather value 0.

103
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,703
If you right click from the nodes timeline, there will be

104
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,129
an option called add alpha output.

105
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:36,503
If you click on that, the output will be added in the blue

106
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:36,790
color.

107
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,117
If you connect the alpha point in the node to the output,

108
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:42,400
you will get the alpha output separately.

109
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,623
When you play this, the portion where you masked will be

110
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:52,180
played.

111
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,300
You have to decide where you can apply this alpha output.

112
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,662
In the masking that we did, not only the gain and shadows,

113
00:06:58,662 --> 00:07:00,460
we can also change the colors.

114
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,320
I am increasing the temperature for their face.

115
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,000
Now, the temperature will increase for their face.

116
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:14,000
With this, the power window tracking class is complete.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We will see further in the next chapter.
