00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,000
In this chapter, I am going to tell you about color rules.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Color rules are always 60, 30, 10.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,393
60% of color is dominant color, 30% of color is highlight

4
00:00:14,393 --> 00:00:17,399
color, and 10% of color is for spices.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,640
I already have a footage here.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,220
I am going to enter the color page.

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:23,879
I am putting full screen.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,399
In this video, only brown is dominant.

9
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,433
Color family may be there, but the palette should not

10
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:29,739
change.

11
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,696
Color family means, all similar colors are included in the

12
00:00:32,696 --> 00:00:33,409
color family.

13
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,000
30% of color is in yellow.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,729
Yellow is here, and yellow is here.

15
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:41,000
White and black do not come in the color palette.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,850
White and black are always common.

17
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,750
So, we do not include them in the color palette.

18
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:51,281
In this, 60% of color is brown, 30% is yellow, and 10% is

19
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:53,000
red for spices.

20
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:56,094
When we shoot and grade, if we follow these color rules and

21
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:58,439
fix the pattern, the video will come out well.

22
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,380
What I just said are pattern rules.

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,140
There are many rules in color.

24
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,630
That is, emotions of color.

25
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:06,000
Each emotion has its own color.

26
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:08,399
I will finally display all of them to you.

27
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:09,560
Watch and learn.
